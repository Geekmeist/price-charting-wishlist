# Price-Charting-Wishlist
This program is used to find the sum of your pricecharting.com wishlist.

Using this program is simple: input the URL to your wishlist, and the program will do the rest for you!
Keep in mind that the larger your wishlist, the longer the program will take to finish. If it looks like it isn't doing anything wait (it can take up to 3-5 minutes) for the program to complete.

Be sure to let me know of any problems through the repository issues page, or any features that you would like to see come to this program.
