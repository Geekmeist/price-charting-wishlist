# price-scraper
This program runs through pricecharting.com to find the total of any set of games, comics, etc., put together.

The EXE program can be found in the dist folder in the release.
 
To use the program you must know a few things: the console and the product ID of the game you are trying to add.
The product ID can be found by searching it on pricecharting.com and hovering over the title. The ID will be a series of numbers.

I plan on adding support for PAL and Japan region games in the future, but NTSC is currently the only region supported.
Please suggest any features that you would like to see added and I hope this program is of use to you!
